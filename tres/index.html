      <p>JavaSciipt is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
        lightweightlanguage. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected
        to theobjects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set
        oflanguage elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
        extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
          Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
          elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
          navigation.
        </li>
        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
          on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
          database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
          perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
          main page about JavaScript.</li>

      <header>javascript and java</header>
      <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
        language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
        follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
        reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
      <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
        system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.JavaScript
        has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.
        Theprototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
        individual
        objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
        be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

      <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
        classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
        protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
        are not explicitly typed.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
      <header>hello world</header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
        codesd</p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");</code>
      </div>

      <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header>variables</header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
        identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
      <p> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
        characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
        characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
      <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
        escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
        _name.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="declaring">
      <header>declaring</header>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
      <p>With the keyword var. For example </p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>var x = 42. </code>
      </div>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. </p>
      <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>x = 42.</code>
      </div>
      <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
        variant. </p>
      <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>let y = 13. </code>
      </div>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <p>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
        condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>while (condition) statement </code>

      </div>
      <p>
        If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
        executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>
      <p>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
        those statements.
      </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
      <di class="code">
        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; } </code>
      </di>

      <p>
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
        Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates. </p>
